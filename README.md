# OnlineAnimeMusic

An Android app for streaming anime music.

## What it does

`OnlineAnimeMusic` (`com.thephoenixit.onlineanimemusic`) plays anime soundtracks
and themes, with a media player, a browsable catalogue, and push notifications
for new releases.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Min SDK:** 15 · **Target/compile SDK:** 26
- **UI:** Android Support Library (`appcompat`, `constraint-layout`), Calligraphy
- **Push:** OneSignal 3.8.3
- **Ads:** Firebase Ads 12.0.1

## Building

The Gradle 4.4 wrapper is checked in, matching AGP 3.1.0. It needs JDK 8 and
an SDK with API 26 and build-tools 27.0.3 installed (`ANDROID_HOME` or
`local.properties`):

```bash
sh gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

## Configuration

The OneSignal app id is set in `app/build.gradle`. Replace it with your own
before publishing. The Firebase configuration file (`google-services.json`) is
not committed.

## Tests

```bash
sh gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

CI installs API 26 / build-tools 27.0.3, sets up JDK 8 and runs the same task.

## Status

Legacy sample app. It uses the pre-AndroidX support library and an old SDK;
modernizing it would require an AndroidX migration and a dependency upgrade.

ExoPlayer 2.7.2 was declared but never used (the only reference was a static
field), and that artifact is no longer published on Maven Central or Google
Maven, so the dependency was removed rather than upgraded. `MainActivity` is
still a placeholder, so there is no player UI yet.
